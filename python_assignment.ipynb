        ">>Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is popular because:\n",
        "\n",
        "*Easy to learn and read .\n",
        "*Large standard library .\n",
        "*Wide use in web development, data science, AI, automation, and more.\n",
        "*Huge community support.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        ">>The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line.\n",
        "It translates the human-readable Python code into machine instructions at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        ">>Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning\n",
        "Example- if, else, while, for, class, def, return.\n",

        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        ">> No ,keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved by the language.\n",
        "\n",

        ">>Mutability refers to whether an object’s content can be changed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Mutable objects can be modified\n",
        "(e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",

        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        ">>Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions and execute code only if certain conditions are true.\n",

        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
